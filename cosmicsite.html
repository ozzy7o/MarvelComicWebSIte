                                </div>

                                <p>Be it Jean Grey, Rachel Summers, or Hope Summers, the Phoenix force has imbued its hosts with incredible power. Initially the Phoenix force wandered the universe as a largely passive entity, but over the years the force of nature took the form of a giant firebird and began to achieve sentience. Coming into contact with sentient beings, the Phoenix began to have desires and thoughts of its own. Eventually it would encounter Jean Grey, the X-Man known then as Marvel Girl.

During their shared history, they have taken many forms, including the “Dark” Phoenix a force of destruction, the “Good” Green Phoenix, and their ultimate form a “White” Phoenix which transcended good and evil. Jean’s daughter from an alternate timeline, Rachel, bonded with the Phoenix and served as her mortal avatar for many years. During their time together, the Phoenix was a force for good and enhanced Rachel’s already impressive telepathic and telekinetic powers. Even after separating, Rachel was shown to still possess enough of an imprint of Phoenix power to pull the minds of her parents two thousand years into the future in order to raise her brother, Cable.

Possibly the Phoenix’s ultimate form is the mutant Hope Summers. The adopted daughter of Cable, Hope was the first mutant born after the M Day event. It’s possible that the Phoenix created Hope to balance out the need for mutants and restore balance after the Scarlet Witch used the power of the Life Force to eradicate them. Eventually, Hope would team up with Wanda and allowed the two primal forces of nature to balance themselves as a yin and yang, restoring the mutant gene on Earth. While this has seemingly burned out the Phoenix, it’s unlikely that it will be gone for long.

It’s also worth noting that as an ability duplicator, Hope possesses the potential to duplicate and permanently retain the powers of everyone she comes into contact with. Potentially, she may one day match the powers of everyone in the Marvel Universe, making her the top of this list.</p>

                                <p>Ah, Loki. Everyone loves you. Deadpool notwithstanding, it’s hard to argue that there has been a bigger breakout character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than Loki, as played by Tom Hiddleston. These days, he’s teetering on the edge of overexposure in the films, but given that he was the reason the Avengers banded together in the first place all those years ago, it’s hard not to slot Loki into the top three in a list like this. In a lot of respects, Loki has the best aspects of a lot of the different characters we’ve mentioned so far. He’s a shapeshifter like Mystique, but he’s not a mercenary. He’s a legit God and not a sort of god (like Dormammu) and his powers are considerably on par with that of Mephisto’s. (Again, depending on what version of Mephisto we’re talking about.) Like Norman Osborn, he’s vindictive. And like Kang, he has access to things that many of the villains in the Marvel Universe don’t. Loki has always been an excellent villain to the heroes of Marvel, and while we can’t speak for theatergoers worldwide, we’re certainly not suffering from Loki Fatigue.

Some could argue; however, that we are suffering from Thanos fatigue. We’ve seen him in a bunch of films at this point, and he has yet to do much of anything but make vague threatening statements and float around in his evil space chair. Loki, however, continues to surprise, impress and entertain with each appearance. So much so that, even if he’s not terribly involved with the events of “Thor: Ragnarok,” the bar has been set pretty high for what limited screen time he does receive in the film. Back in the world of comics, though, the fact that he’s running for president — and would stand a real shot at winning in the real world if he were to run — says it all concerning how terrifying the character can be.</p>

                                <p>The Hulk is the strongest one there is. It’s been said many times, but it’s true. In terms of sheer physical strength, nobody can beat the Hulk. While The Sentry fought the Hulk to a standstill during the World War Hulk storyline, The Hulk quickly powered back up and threatened to destroy the whole east coast of America and may have done so if not powered down by orbiting satellites, temporarily depowering him.

He has fought and beaten powerhouses such as Thor (at his normal power levels), Hercules, Onslaught, Juggernaut, and the Abomination. He once had the combined weight of a mountain on his back, and held it there, preventing the deaths of the assembled heroes present, after having it dropped on him by the Molecule Man during the original Secret Wars. While his strength is seemingly limitless, it is dependent on his mental state. As his rage increases, his strength levels increase. Literally “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger he gets.” Often considered the original Omega Level threat, there has yet to be a limit to the physical power of The Hulk.</p>

                                <p>The Silver Surfer is one of the most powerful beings in the universe, and the most powerful of the Heralds of Galactus. Imbued with the Power Cosmic by Galactus himself, he has near limitless energy absorption and manipulation abilities that manifest in a variety of ways. Being capable of manipulating the four fundamental forces of the universe, The Silver Surfer can discharge energy far exceeding that of other cosmic-powered being such as Quasar and Nova. His energy based powers are currently seen to be equal to those of Thanos, if not greater, and are capable of destroying planets. As well as manipulating energy, he has been able to manipulate matter to the point where he can effortlessly transmute one substance into another.

Along with these abilities, The Silver Surfer has physical strength which is comparable to an enraged Hulk. Along with intergalactic flight at superluminal speeds, The Surfer can use the Power Cosmic to sense events across the cosmos.</p>

                                <p>Was there any doubt in your mind that Doctor Doom wouldn’t be on this list? Or that he’d be our top pick? Doom has done and threatened them all in the Marvel Universe, including the recent “Secret Wars” crossover series. Regarding 21st Century Doom stories, though, it’s been pretty hard for writers at Marvel to top Mark Waid & Mike Wieringo’s “Unthinkable” in the pages of “Fantastic Four.” There, Doom makes a deal with demons, skins his childhood friend alive to make armor out of her (we’re not kidding), uses magic to change Reed and Sue’s daughter’s parentage so that he would be the father — and it just gets crazier from there. If there were ever a story that betters defined who Doom is and what motivates him in the modern era of comics, this one would be it. Although Doom is a human, since he first debuted in the 1960s he has consistently found a way to become the strongest and deadliest adversary the Marvel Universe has faced, without much of the limitations some of the others on this list have. (Thanos without his Infinity Gauntlet, for example. Ultron without a high-speed internet connection. You get the idea.)

Although his film rights are currently tied up over at Fox, preventing Doom from menacing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there’s little doubt in most fans minds that he, and not Thanos, should have been the marquee villain of the movies. And that’s an opinion many held after Fox managed to mess up, not once, not twice, but three times Doctor Doom on screen. That’s how great a villain he is. You can totally blow the character’s depiction, and fans of the comics will continue to insist, much like Doom himself, that he is the smartest, worst, and coolest villain Marvel has at its disposal.</p>

                                <p> At his worst, The Green Goblin is written as a Joker knockoff. At his best, however, the Green Goblin can be monstrous and terrifying. Showing off a vindictive streak that rivals most of the villains who appear on this list. And while he certainly lacks the power that many of the other characters here have at their disposal, it’s been shown time and time again that Norman Osborn will do and say whatever it takes to get the kind of power that will make him a threat. Not only to Spider-Man but the entire Marvel Universe. Given that he’s Earthbound, unlike some of the other choices here, Osborn is a constant threat to each and every hero that stands in the way of what he wants. Lacking the nobility or morals that would prevent other characters on this list also means Osborn represents a clear and present danger to not only the heroes of the Marvel Universe but all of its inhabitants.

We would make the argument that Thanos doesn’t necessarily see himself as a villain. He has shown at times a streak that isn’t quite compassionate, but can border on it. Thanos only wants what he wants, and views the death of trillions of beings as a way to get exactly that. Other times, when not courting Death, he’s more interested in ruling, or discovering new sources of power that would allow him to protect himself from his enemies. With the Green Goblin, there is no compassion. There’s no nobility. And there’s no sense of humor unless you think dropping people off bridges is hilarious. (He totally does.) The Goblin has wormed his way to the top before, and he will do so again. With Thanos, he’s been to the top, but no one remembers it because of the constant Deus Ex Machina involved in resetting his victories. With Osborn, everyone remembers. So much so that he had to go and change his face just so he can do it all over again.</p>

As Lord of Asgard, Thor possessed the Odinforce, which enabled him to tap into the near-infinite resources of cosmic and mystical energies, enhancing all of his abilities.

                                <p>Like many others in this list, Thor’s power levels are inconsistent. At his classic power levels, he is fractionally less physically powerful than The Hulk but has energy manipulation powers thanks to his ownership of Mjolnir.

While physically in the same league as Hulk and Juggernaut, it’s his magical abilities that make him generally more powerful. Being the son of Odin, he has on occasion been in possession of the Odin force. The Odin force is one of the greatest powers in the universe and in an alternate timeline Thor used it to subjugate humanity and all the powered beings on Earth. At this power level he was beyond the abilities of the other Gods of the Marvel Universe. In this near-omnipotent state, he undid several centuries of history without much more than a thought.

He is also the son of Gaea, which grants him certain magical abilities on Earth. While he is rarely shown to use these abilities, he has been seen to open a chasm between two nations in order to make their conflict harder, giving the peacemakers a chance to end the conflict.</p>

Moreover, he can use his magnetic powers in more than one way simultaneously. He can completely assemble a complicated machine within seconds through his powers. He can erect magnetic force fields with a high degree of impenetrability around himself for protection.

Although Magneto’s primary power is control over magnetism, he can also project or manipulate any form of energy that is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays. However, Magneto almost always uses only magnetism, since it’s more difficult for him to manipulate other forms of energy. Magneto has also exhibited powers of astral projection and telepathy, and has claimed to be able to control the minds of others, though his abilities along these lines appear to be minimal.

                                <p>You’ll notice a lot of the villains on this list have a bit of a nobility streak. We’re not sure what that says about Marvel villains or just great villains in general, but Magneto wins the nobility game every time. Case in point: If he wanted to, he could flip the planet on its axis and kill everyone. Perhaps only doing so after squirreling away the mutants he likes on, and we can’t stress this enough, an asteroid he made and named for himself. But. He doesn’t do this. Instead Magneto, unlike everyone else on this list, is fighting an ideological battle. One that often sees him play both sides, sometimes against each other, to get what he wants.

In some ways it’s a disappointment these days to see Magneto increasingly portrayed as a hero in the comics., But when the day comes that he decides to go full villain again, there’s no doubt in our mind that he’s capable of doing a ton of damage to everyone and anyone to get what he wants. The mere fact that he could end all life on Earth with just a thought, without exerting any effort at all, makes him more terrifying than Thanos ever could be as far as we’re concerned.</p>

                                        <span>Powers:</span>Adam Warlock possesses a number of superhuman properties and powers derived from his artificially determined genetic structure. His bone and muscle tissue is denser than human, endowing him with superhuman strength and resilience. Among his body's special adaptations are an enclave of cells able to tap and transform cosmic energy for personal use. Warlock could use this energy to enhance his physical strength, endurance, and powers of recuperation. He could also employ cosmic energy to negate the force of gravity beneath him, enabling him to fly. In an Earth-like atmosphere, Warlock was able to attain the speed of sound (770 miles per hour). He could use his cosmic energy to locate and enter natural space-warps (discontinuities in the fabric of space) in order to traverse interstellar space. He can also project cosmic energy from his hands as concussive force.

Warlock's energy-manipulating powers waned at the time he was given the soul-gem by the High Evolutionary. No longer could he direct concussive force from his hands or enhance his strength. Whether this power limitation was caused by his symbiotic relationship with the soul-gem or some other factor is not yet known. When Warlock was summoned from the soul-gem to defeat Thanos, he seemed to possess these cosmic powers once more.
He is is able to spin a cocoon around him at will in a matter of seconds. He did so infrequently during his short life, usually to protect himself from mortal harm, and usually he would emerge from the cocoon at a further level of physical or mental maturity. It is not known where the substance of the cocoon came from, or where it went after he emerged from it.

                                <p>Created artificially by a collective known as The Beehive, Adam Warlock was created to be the perfect human, a being at the very peak of human evolution. The result was a being of near godlike power, but with no life experience. Eventually coming into possession of the Soul Gem, and later the Infinity Gauntlet, Adam Warlock has at times been the undisputed “God” of the Marvel Universe.

Even without these additional items of power, Adam Warlock has shown himself to be a being of incredible power. He has used his abilities to generate energy blasts capable of disabling The Silver Surfer and Nova without effort. He has also demonstrated the ability to manipulate matter and transmute objects at a greater level to most entities within the Marvel universe.</p>
